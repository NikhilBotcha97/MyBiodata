    <h2>Self Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        My name is <b>BOTCHA NIKHIL</b>, and I’m a recent computer science graduate.

I completed my <b>B.Tech</b> in <mark>CSE-AIML</mark> from Dadi institute of engineering and technology, 
where I developed a strong foundation in Programming and analytical skills. During my time there, 
I had completed Internships on <i>Full Stack development, Database management system, AIML</i> and 
also certifications like <i>Azure(AI-900) Fundamentals</i> from microsoft,<i>cyber Security</i>  
from cisco,<i> Machine learning</i> from AWS academy,  which really helped me grow in terms of developing 
my programming skills and problem solving abilities.

<br>Professionally, I’ve had experience working in my final year project titled 
<b>Real Time Emergency response system and Traffic Management</b>, where I have developed a model which 
detects the emergency vehicles in high traffic areas and prevents the traffic for emergency vehicles to reach their destination without any delay and save life.

<br>Some of my core strengths include problem-solving, communication, teamwork. I’m especially passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, creating engaging content, building efficient systems and I’m always looking to learn and grow in this space.

Right now, I’m looking for a new opportunity where I can contribute meaningfully and continue developing my skills. I’m excited about the possibility of working with like-minded professionals and being part of something impactful.
